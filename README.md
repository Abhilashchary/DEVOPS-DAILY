📌 Project Name: DevOps Daily
1. Project Overview

DevOps Daily is a simple, automated web application that displays a "daily quote" to users.
The project’s main goal is to demonstrate a complete DevOps pipeline, from code changes to automated deployment.

This project focuses on showcasing key DevOps concepts:

Version Control with GitHub

Containerization with Docker

Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

Continuous Deployment (CD) to a live environment

Automation of the software delivery lifecycle

2. Tools Used

GitHub — for source code management and version control

Docker — to containerize the application

GitHub Actions — to create a CI/CD pipeline

Docker Hub — to store container images

Play with Docker — to run the application online

VS Code — development environment

3. How It Works

Step-by-Step Flow:

Code & Version Control

All project files (index.html, quotes.txt, Dockerfile) are stored in GitHub.

Any change (e.g., updating quotes.txt) is committed and pushed to GitHub.

CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions detects changes and runs a workflow (main.yml).

The workflow builds a Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub.

CD Deployment

The latest image is pulled from Docker Hub and deployed to an online environment (Play with Docker).

The application becomes instantly available online.

Observability

Logs and status are monitored in GitHub Actions.

Deployment success can be verified via the live URL.

7. Key Learning Outcomes

Understanding DevOps pipelines: How a change in code triggers build & deploy automatically.

CI/CD expertise: Setting up GitHub Actions for automated workflows.

Containerization: Packaging an app using Docker.

Cloud deployment basics: Running a Docker container online without local setup.

8. Future Improvements

Add a database to store quotes.

Use a proper cloud service (AWS, DigitalOcean) for continuous deployment.

Add monitoring tools to track uptime and logs.

Add an API to fetch quotes dynamically.
